PerfMon
azspriggs@gmail.com

This app leverages and extends the Netmeter app:
https://github.com/dphans/android-labs/tree/master/NetMeterk
to provide performance monitoring (battery and cpu).  

The PerfMon tool is an Android application and service which can be used for a variety of performance-related 
monitoring and analysis activities.  The tool is a work in progress - any comments/suggestions/complaints 
are welcome and encouraged.  

Some key features of the tool include:
- Watching CPU usage over time
- Watching Memory usage over time
- Monitoring memory usage of individual applications over time
- Tracking instances of low memory by notifying and logging memory usage whenever the Android Activity Manager starts reclaiming memory due to low memory conditions.
- Forcefully allocating native RAM to simulate low memory conditions.  This can be useful to simulate the effects of adding additional code to a product which may already be tight on RAM or to analyze the effects of a low memory condition on KPI metrics.
- Launching the browser with a predefined set of browser profiles and capturing memory usage.  This was introduced to help test part of the Webtop3.0 feature.
- Forcefully dumping procrank output to a log file.

Important Notes:
The app does not hold any wake locks, but does result in a non-negligable CPU and Memory overhead as it includes a service which polls every 5 seconds.
The app will work on ICS and later Android versions but has not been updated since JellyBean timeframe.  Since that time, SELinux policy has blocked the app
from looking at certain areas like /proc - some work needs to be done to resolve this and restore some of this functionality.
